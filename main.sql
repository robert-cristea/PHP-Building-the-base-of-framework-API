We conducted 16 interviews (involving 22 people) with leadership and practitioners, and observations (job-shadowing) with 14 of those we interviewed. Key takeaways included: (a) practitioners came from a variety of backgrounds resulting in multidisciplinary teams; (b) leadership desired UX employees that were generalists; and (c) inexpensive tools designed for UX were common for creating artifacts and facilitating communication resulting in a dynamic tool-scape. These findings have implications for instructors teaching in UX and students in UX programs; we also argue the findings will interest UX practitioners who are curious about sharing and learning from each other.', '');

Many people do not know how to actually provide effective feedback. There is increasing demand for quality feedback – and thus feedback givers – in learning and professional settings. This paper contributes empirical evidence that two interactive techniques – reusable suggestions and adaptive guidance – can improve feedback on creative work. We present these techniques embodied in the CritiqueKit system to help reviewers give specific, actionable, and justified feedback. Two real-world deployment studies and two controlled experiments with CritiqueKit found that adaptively-presented suggestions improve the quality of feedback from novice reviewers. Reviewers also reported that suggestions and guidance helped them describe their thoughts and reminded them to provide effective feedback.', 'HONORABLE_MENTION');

Simultaneously, speech synthesis is becoming more sophisticated and manipulable, providing the opportunity to optimize speech rate to save users time. However, little is known about people''s abilities to understand fast speech. In this work, we provide the first large-scale study on human listening rates. Run on LabintheWild, it used volunteer participants, was screen reader accessible, and measured listening rate by accuracy at answering questions spoken by a screen reader at various rates. Our results show that blind and low-vision people, who often rely on audio cues and access text aurally, generally have higher listening rates than sighted people. The findings also suggest a need to expand the range of rates available on personal devices. These results demonstrate the potential for users to learn to listen to faster rates, expanding the possibilities for human-conversational agent interaction.', '');

However, multiclass SPLOMs have issues with overdraw (overlapping points), and most existing techniques for alleviating overdraw focus on individual scatterplots with a single class. This paper explores whether animation using flickering points is an effective way to alleviate overdraw in these multiclass SPLOMs. In a user study with 69 participants, we found that users not only performed better at identifying dense regions using animated SPLOMs, but also found them easier to interpret and preferred them to static SPLOMs. These results open up new directions for future work on alleviating overdraw for multiclass SPLOMs, and provide insights for applying animation to alleviate overdraw in other settings.', '');

Our study is structured around a conceptual system we designed, one that mediates the spatial attributes of the surroundings according to the user''s and collocated people''s emotional states. After the initial ideation of the concept, we built a prototype application for HoloLens. We then conducted a 2-legged user study with 12 participants; first we gathered data using an online survey, followed by a study with thinking aloud protocol using the prototype. We believe that the results and discussion we provide in this paper will be useful in development of emotionally aware Mixed Reality systems.', '');

Yet, exactly how users of such devices practically thread that use into their everyday social interactions remains underexplored. By collecting and studying audio data from month-long deployments of the Amazon Echo in participants’ homes—informed by ethnomethodology and conversation analysis—our study documents the methodical practices of VUI users, and how that use is accomplished in the complex social life of the home. Data we present shows how the device is made accountable to and embedded into conversational settings like family dinners where various simultaneous activities are being achieved. We discuss how the VUI is finely coordinated with the sequential organisation of talk. Finally, we locate implications for the accountability of VUI interaction, request and response design, and raise conceptual challenges to the notion of designing ‘conversational’ interfaces.', 'BEST_PAPER');

Very recent research has demonstrated the significance of this limitation, identifying critical relationships between Google and Wikipedia that are highly relevant to many areas of Wikipedia-based research and practice. This paper extends this recent research beyond search engines to examine Wikipedia’s relationships with large-scale online communities, Stack Overflow and Reddit in particular. We find evidence of consequential, albeit unidirectional relationships. Wikipedia provides substantial value to both communities, with Wikipedia content increasing visitation, engagement, and revenue, but we find little evidence that these websites contribute to Wikipedia in return. Overall, these findings highlight important connections between Wikipedia and its broader ecosystem that should be considered by researchers studying Wikipedia. Critically, our results also emphasize the key role that volunteer-created Wikipedia content plays in improving other websites, even contributing to revenue generation.', 'BEST_PAPER');

The aim of the present study is to identify a cooperative lane change indication which other drivers understand unambiguously and prefer when it comes to lane change announcements in a dense traffic situation on the highway. A fixed-base driving simulator study is conducted with N = 66 participants in Germany in a car-following scenario. Participants rated, from the lag driver’s perspective, different lane change announcements of another driver which varied in lateral movements (i.e., duration, lateral offset). Main findings indicate that a medium offset and moderate duration of lateral movement is experienced as most cooperative. The results are crucial for the development of lane change strategies for automated vehicles.', '');

Recent research in HCI has been investigating SoA to provide users an instinctive sense of “I did that” as opposed to “the system did that”. However, current agency measurements are limited. The Intentional Binding (IB) paradigm provides an implicit measure of the SoA, however, it is constrained by requiring high visual attention to a “Libet clock” on-screen. In this paper, we extended the timing stimuli through auditory and tactile cues. Our results demonstrate that audio timing through voice commands and haptic timing through tactile cues on the hand, are an effective alternative measure of the SoA using the IB paradigm. They both address current limitations of the traditional method such as visual attention overload and lack of engagement. We discuss how our results can be applied to measure SoA in tasks involving different interactive scenarios such as in Mixed/Virtual Reality.', '');

A live coder uses any available video from YouTube, a video streaming service, as source material to perform an improvised audiovisual piece. The challenge is to manipulate the emerging media that are streamed from a networked service given the limited functionality of the API provided. The piece finds parallels in early experimental music that manipulates magnetic tape and vinyl records. On the contrary, the audiovisual space that a musician can explore on the fly is practically infinite.

This paper examines public reaction “in the wild” to two data sharing controversies that were the focus of media attention—regarding the social media and communication services Facebook and WhatsApp, as well as the email service unroll.me. These controversies instigated discussion of data privacy and ethics, accessibility of website policies, notions of responsibility for privacy, cost-benefit analyses, and strategies for privacy management such as non-use. An analysis of reactions and interactions captured by comments on news articles not only reveals information about pervasive privacy attitudes, but also suggests communication and design strategies that could benefit both platforms and users.', '');

Because of this misconception, most people do not know how extensive and how many people are affected by poverty. The problem is commonly ignored in Bryan/College Station, TX, mainly on the college campuses in the area. One Step was created to address this misconception and bridge the gap between people who are affected by poverty and those who are not.

However, native speakers (NS) may dominate cross-lingual teamwork communicating solely in a common language, which may reduce diversity and harm productivity of the whole group. As a solution, we consider it necessary to support non-native speakers’ (NNS) contribution for equalizing NS’ and NNS’ participation. In this study, we examine how recent language support technologies might affect the group dynamics of collocated multilingual teams consisting of multiple NSs and NNSs. In our experiment, quads of two NSs and two NNSs were provided with a language support tool that integrates machine translation, automatic speech recognition and shared display to enable NNSs participating in multilingual teamwork without requiring them to use a common language. Automatic language detection allowed them to dynamically decide what language to use in their group discussions. We found that using the tool increased the variety of languages used (e.g., Chinese, English and Japanese) and had the potential to equalize NS’ and NNS’ participation.', '');

Over the past 5 years we have been extensively  involved in the design of pervasive and mobile technologies to support  out-of-clinic physical rehabilitation. Two strands guide our work: situated  and embodied interaction, and the practice and theory of physical  rehabilitation.

We revisit this work from the  emerging perspective of lived informatics to bring forward multiple  instances of rehabilitees using personal rehabilitation data to make  sense of their physical rehabilitation process. We present these  instances under four categories: becoming your own standard of reference;  marking your life as a rehabilitee; articulating with therapists,  partners, and peers; and incorporating exercising with everyday activities.  We put forward the Person–Environment–Occupation model as a  generative entry point for designing digital technology in support of  lived informatics in out-of-clinic physical rehabilitation.

Despite the growing relevance of flow at work, contemporary measurement approaches of flow are of subjective and retrospective nature, limiting our possibilities to investigate and support flow in a reliable and timely manner. Hence, we require objective and real-time classification of flow.

We subtly exposed participants to feedback that they perceived to be provided by people ''like them'', and experimentally controlled the tone and content of the feedback to provide either positive, negative, or no social proof. We then measured how participants'' quantitative and qualitative evaluations of an HCI artifact changed based on the feedback to which they were exposed. We conducted two controlled experiments: an online experiment with 245 MTurk workers and a field experiment with 63 women in rural India. Our findings reveal significant differences between participants in the positive, negative, and no social proof conditions, both online and in the field.

This paper explores instructor and learner perceptions of in-video prompting where learners answer reflective questions while watching videos. We conducted two studies with crowd workers to understand the effect of prompting in general, and the effect of different prompting strategies on both learners and instructors. Results show that some learners found prompts to be useful checkpoints for reflection, while others found them distracting. Instructors reported the collected responses to be generally more specific than what they have usually collected. Also, different prompting strategies had different effects on the learning experience and the usefulness of responses as feedback.', '');

However, typical visual representations of gaze only reflect a single feature such as the current fixation point. As eye tracking technology becomes more affordable and ubiquitous it is important to consider the entire design space for visualizing eye movements. The Iris system allows users to quickly design visualizations to represent gaze patterns in real time.

Hence, conventional desktop peripherals are very slow, imprecise, and cumbersome. We developed a apparatus that tracks the user''s hands, and a physical keyboard, and visualize them in VR. In a text input study with 32 participants, we investigated the achievable text entry speed and the effect of hand representations and transparency on typing performance, workload, and presence. With our {apparatus}, experienced typists benefited from seeing their hands, and reach almost outside-VR performance. Inexperienced typists profited from semi-transparent hands, which enabled them to type just 5.6 WPM slower than with a regular desktop setup. We conclude that optimizing the visualization of hands in VR is important, especially for inexperienced typists, to enable a high typing performance.', '');

Based on interviews with fourteen participants we describe how: i) their economic value is intertwined with data and skills related to specific applications; ii) their access to this value is systematically jeopardised in collaboration due to the different application practices, preferences, and proficiencies of other stakeholders; and iii) they mitigate the costs of this compromise through cross-application collaboration strategies. We trace these experiences to common characteristics of applications, such as update processes, interface symmetries, application-document relationships, and operating system and hardware dependencies. By empirically and analytically focusing on "the application", we reveal the implications of the current application-centric computing paradigm and discuss how variations within this model create qualitatively different human-computer interactions.', '');

In line with prior research, participants (N = 65) reported greater feelings of presence in the High Immersion condition compared to Low Immersion. However, immersive condition was not significantly related to narrative engagement or empathy.

Thus, it is impossible for application developers to predict at design time the devices and objects users will exploit, how they will be arranged, and in which situations and for which objectives they will be used. For such reasons, it is important to make end users able to easily and autonomously personalize the behaviour of their Internet of Things applications, so that they can better comply with their specific expectations. In this paper, we present a method and a set of tools that allow end users without programming experience to customize the context-dependent behaviour of their Web applications through the specification of trigger-action rules. The environment is able to support end-user specification of more flexible behaviour than what can be done with existing commercial tools, and it also includes an underlying infrastructure able to detect the possible contextual changes in order to achieve the desired behaviour. The resulting set of tools is able to support the dynamic creation and execution of personalized application versions more suitable for users’ needs in specific contexts of use. Thus, it represents a contribution to obtaining low threshold/high ceiling environments.

Users frequently create passwords that are predictable for attackers [1, 9] or make other decisions (e.g., reusing the same password across accounts) that harm their security [2, 8]. In this thesis,1 I use data-driven methods to better understand how users choose passwords and how attackers guess passwords. I then combine these insights into a better password-strength meter that provides real-time, data-driven feedback about the user’s password.    I first quantify the impact on password security and usability of showing users different password-strength meters that score passwords using basic heuristics. I find in a 2,931- participant online study that meters that score passwords stringently and present their strength estimates visually lead users to create stronger passwords without significantly impacting password memorability [6]. Second, to better understand how attackers guess passwords, I perform comprehensive experiments on password-cracking approaches. I find that simply running these approaches in their default configuration is insufficient, but considering multiple well-configured approaches in parallel can serve as a proxy for guessing by an expert in password forensics [9]. The third and fourth sections of this thesis delve further into how users choose passwords. Through a series of analyses, I pinpoint ways in which users structure semantically significant content in their passwords [7]. I also examine the relationship between users’ perceptions of password security and passwords’ actual security, finding that while users often correctly judge the security impact of individual password characteristics, wide variance in their understanding of attackers may lead users to judge predictable passwords as sufficiently strong [5]. Finally, I integrate these insights into an open-source2 password-strength meter that gives users data-driven feedback about their specific password. This meter uses neural networks [3] and numerous carefully combined heuristics to score passwords and generate data-driven text feedback about a given password. I evaluate this meter through a ten-participant laboratory study and 4,509-participant online study [4]. Under the more common password-composition policy we tested, we find that the data-driven meter with detailed feedback leads users to create more secure, and no less memorable, passwords than a meter with only a bar as a strength indicator.    In sum, the objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how integrating data-driven insights about how users create and how attackers guess passwords into a tool that presents real-time feedback can help users make better passwords.', '');

In many cases, they make up a majority of readily accessible indoor surface area, and yet they are static – their primary function is to be a wall, separating spaces and hiding infrastructure. We present Wall++, a low-cost sensing approach that allows walls to become a smart infrastructure. Instead of merely separating spaces, walls can now enhance rooms with sensing, interactivity and computation. Our wall treatment and sensing hardware can track users’ touch and gestures, as well as estimate body pose if they are close. By capturing airborne electromagnetic noise, we can also recognize what appliances are active and where they are located, and track and identify signal-emitting tags carried by users. Through a series of evaluations, we demonstrate Wall++ can enable robust room-scale interactive and context sensing applications.', 'BEST_PAPER');

Hearing aids often fail to offer enough benefits and have low adoption rates. However, people with hearing loss find that speechreading can improve their understanding during conversation, but speechreading is a challenging skill to learn. Speechreading classes can improve acquisition, however there are a limited number of classes available and students can only practice effectively when attending class. To address this, we conducted a postal survey with 59 speechreading students to understand students'' perspectives on practicing. Using our findings, we developed an Android application called MirrorMirror - a new Speechreading Acquisition Tool (SAT) that allows students to practice their speechreading by recording and watching videos of people they frequently speak with.  We evaluated MirrorMirror through three case studies with speechreading students and found that they could effectively target their speechreading practice on people, words and situations they encounter during daily conversations.', '');

However, for a wider range of usage they need to be miniaturized while maintaining the quality of haptic feedback. In this study, we used two kinds of human sensory illusion of vibration. The first illusion involves creating a virtual force (pulling sensation) using asymmetric vibration, and the second involves imparting compliances of complex stress-strain curves (i.e. force-displacement curves of mechanical keyboards) to a rigid object by changing the frequency and amplitude of vibration. Using these two illusions, we developed a wearable tactile device named HapCube, consisting of three orthogonal voicecoil actuators. Four measurement tests and four user tests confirmed that 1) a combination of two orthogonal asymmetric vibrations could provide a 2D virtual force in any tangential directions on a finger pad, and 2) a single voicecoil actuator produced pseudo-force feedback of the complex compliance curves in the normal direction.', 'HONORABLE_MENTION');

While retrospective feedback can help us improve for next time, feedback “in action” can allow us to improve the outcome of on-going tasks. In this paper, we use data from functional Near InfraRed Spectroscopy to provide participants with feedback about their Mental Workload levels during high-workload tasks. We evaluate the impact of this feedback on task performance and perceived task performance, in comparison to industry standard mid-task self assessments, and explore participants’ perceptions of this feedback. In line with previous work, we confirm that deploying self-reporting methods affect both perceived and actual performance. Conversely, we conclude that our objective concurrent feedback correlated more closely with task demand, supported reflection in action, and did not negatively affect performance. Future work, however, should focus on the design of this feedback and the potential behaviour changes that will result.', '');

Since sensing is prone to errors, sensors may disagree. For example, a GPS-based tracker on the phone and a sensor on the bike wheel may provide discrepant estimates on traveled distance. This poses a user dilemma, namely how to reconcile the conflicting information into one estimate. We investigated whether visualizing the uncertainty associated with sensor measurements improves the quality of users'' inference. We tested four visualizations with increasingly detailed representation of uncertainty. Our study repeatedly presented two sensor measurements with varying degrees of inconsistency to participants who indicated their best guess of the "true" value. We found that uncertainty information improves users'' estimates, especially if sensors differ largely in their associated variability. Improvements were larger for information-rich visualizations.

The introduction of force-sensitive touchscreens has added another enhancement to text selection (using force for different selection modes); however, these modes are difficult to discover and many users continue to struggle with accurate selection. In this paper we report on an investigation of the design of touch-based and force-based text selection mechanisms, and describe two novel text-selection techniques that provide improved discoverability, enhanced visual feedback, and a higher performance ceiling for experienced users. Two evaluations show that one design successfully combined support for novices and experts, was never worse than the standard iOS technique, and was preferred by participants.', '');

We conducted two user studies showing that participants intuitively associated them with the sensation of weight and accept them as part of the virtual world. We further show that compared to no weight simulation, our approach led to significantly higher levels of presence, immersion and enjoyment.

Accordingly, we conducted a two-month, in-depth qualitative study, exploring low-SES caregivers’ perspectives on PA tracking and promotion. Our findings show how PA tracking was impacted by caregivers’ attitudes toward safety, which were influenced by how they perceived social connections within their neighborhoods; and cognitive-emotional processes.

We surveyed 175 individuals for comparative and individual assessments of risk, including characterizations using psychological factors. We report our observations around group differences (e.g., expert versus non-expert) in how people assess risk, and what factors may structure their conceptions of technological harm. Our findings suggest that technologists see these risks as posing a bigger threat to society than do non-experts. Moreover, across groups, participants did not see technological risks as voluntarily assumed. Differences in how people characterize risk have implications for the future of design, decision-making, and public communications, which we discuss through a lens we call risk-sensitive design.

We surveyed 171 players about a challenging or an emotionally challenging experience, and analyzed their responses with regards to what made the experience challenging, their emotional response, and the relation to core player experience constructs. We found that emotional challenge manifested itself in different ways, by confronting players with difficult themes or decisions, as well as having them deal with intense emotions. In contrast to more ''conventional'' challenge, emotional challenge evoked a wider range of negative emotions and was appreciated significantly more by players.

To address these limitations, we employ illusions such as redirection, scaling, and retargeting that take advantage of the visual dominance effect, the idea that vision often dominates when senses conflict. Our evaluation of these techniques suggests that redirecting sloped lines with angles less than 40 degrees onto a horizontal line is an effective technique for increasing the perceived resolution of the display. Scaling up the virtual object onto the shape display by a factor less than 1.8x can also increase the perceived resolution. Finally, using vertical redirection a perceived 3x speed increase can be achieved.', 'HONORABLE_MENTION');

Our research studies the tradeoffs between privacy and utility of personal information for human decision making. Using a record-linkage scenario, this paper presents a controlled study of how varying degrees of information availability influences the ability to effectively use personal information. We compared the quality of human decision-making using a visual interface that controls the amount of personal information available using visual markup to highlight data discrepancies. With this interface, study participants who viewed only 30% of data content had decision quality similar to those who had full 100% access. The results demonstrate that it is possible to greatly limit the amount of personal information available to human decision makers without negatively affecting utility or human effectiveness. However, the findings also show there is a limit to how much data can be hidden before negatively influencing the quality of judgment in decisions involving person-level data. Despite the reduced accuracy with extreme data hiding, the study demonstrates that with proper interface designs, many correct decisions can be made with even legally de-identified data that is fully masked (74.5% accuracy with fully-masked data compared to 84.1% with full access). Thus, when legal requirements only allow for de-identified data access, use of well-designed interface can significantly improve data utility.  ', 'HONORABLE_MENTION');

From this perspective, co-performance acknowledges the dynamic differences in capabilities between humans and artifacts, and highlights the fundamentally recursive relation between professional design and use.

Yet, there is a need to further address how we design for slowness on conceptual and practical levels. Drawing on the concepts of unawareness, intersections, and ensembles, we contribute an investigation into designing for slowness and temporality grounded in design practice through two cases: Olly and Slow Game. We designed these artifacts over two and a half years with careful attention to how the set of concepts influenced key design decisions in terms of their form, materials, and computational qualities. Our designer-researcher approach revealed that, when put into practice, the concepts helped generatively grapple with slowness and temporality, but are in need of further development to be mobilized for design. We critically reflect on insights emerging across our practice-based research to reflexively refine the concepts and better support future HCI research and practice.  ', '');

Released in 2002, the P3P standard allowed websites to communicate about privacy in a computer-readable format that could be consumed by web browsers and other user agents to inform users and take actions on their behalf. I worked with (and eventually led) a team of technologists, lawyers, and policy makers, and became familiar with not only technologies for protecting and invading privacy, but also international privacy laws and self-regulatory privacy programs. As the working group debated details such as the precise definitions of data sharing and identifiable information, I came to the realization that we hadn’t thought much about how to make P3P tools usable. Indeed, usability issues had been largely ignored in the development of most security and privacy tools at that time.    At the end of 2003, I moved on to academia and focused my research on usable privacy and security. Along with my students and colleagues, I conducted empirical studies to evaluate privacy and security tools, and recommended ways to make these tools more usable. We asked study participants to make privacy sensitive purchases (condoms and sex toys), and conducted some of the first Mechanical Turk studies related to privacy. Our research papers provided empirical evidence about how long it would take people if they actually did read privacy policies (too long!), that ad-industry-driven privacy efforts were largely ineffective, that privacy “nutrition labels” could help people compare company privacy practices, and that many people care enough about privacy to actually pay for it. We presented our research at events at the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and on Capitol Hill.    In 2016 I spent a year in Washington, DC as Chief Technologist at the FTC.

However, these attempts have focused on increasing human-like traits of agents, thereby overlooking the possible advantage of machine inherits, such as lack of emotion or the ability to perform calculations. Therefore, this paper aims to shed light on the machine inherits of CAs to help satisfy the emotional needs of teenagers. We conducted a workshop with 20 teenagers, followed by in-depth interviews with six of the participants. We discovered that teenagers expected CAs to (1) be good listeners due to their lack of emotion, (2) keep their secrets by being separated from the human world, and (3) give them advice based on the analysis of sufficient data. Based on our findings, we offer three design guidelines to build CAs.', '');

In video-mediated communication, however, such nonverbal cues become "ineffectual" when they are presented via a 2D monitor, making video-mediated collaborative physical tasks inefficient. This study focuses on gaze cues to support remote collaborative physical tasks and uses an eye-shaped display, "ThirdEye," a simple add-on display that represents a remote participant''s gaze direction. ThirdEye is expected to be especially effective when used with mobile terminals. We investigated whether the ThirdEye''s gaze shift is effective in leading a local observer''s attention toward objects in the local environment, even when ThirdEye is presented with the actual face image of a remote person. Experimental results show that ThirdEye can lead the local participant’s attention to intended objects faster than without ThirdEye.', '');

And prior work suggests many people still do not understand them. Thus, two challenges remain: increasing both comprehension and adherence rates. To dig deeper into user decision making and comprehension of warnings, we performed an experience sampling study of web browser security warnings, which involved surveying over 6,000 Chrome and Firefox users in situ to gather reasons for adhering or not to real warnings. We find these reasons are many and vary with context. Contrary to older prior work, we do not find a single dominant failure in modern warning design---like habituation---that prevents effective decisions.

Users’ perceptions of a single tactile stimulus and multiple tactile stimuli were also investigated. The obtained experimental results indicate that the proposed tactile display is capable of exhibiting realistic tactile sensation and can be incorporated by various applications such as tactile sensation printing of pictorial illustrations and paintings. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid tactile display can contribute to accelerated prototyping and development of new tactile devices.', '');

ACM Classification Keywords  H.5.m. Creative interactive interface architectures     Background  The proposal is centrally about an integrated color/sound space. For this work we do not intend to adhere to any preconceived ideas or theorems that assign individual colors to specific pitches or timbres within the sound spectrum. As artists our individual perception and reaction to the complexities inherent in a color or a sound is beyond simple categorization. Generalities do not reflect the countless variations and subtle nuances in hue and tone that pervade the audio and visual world.  And in many cases, whilst observations can be subjective, objective assumptions can be historically misleading.    There have been many experiments where the pitch of a sound has been associated with a specific color but where for the pitch of A can differ by as much as two or three tones - the assumptions become meaningless in quantitative terms. Not until concert pitch at A440 was established in the C20th did comparisons have authority.  However, there have been some relevant and fascinating experiments in the past worth revisiting.  Of particular interest is Louis Betrand Castel’s invention the Ocular Harpsichord designed 1730 with 60 separate visual color windows assigned to a key (similar early color organ) [2]. Each color was revealed not as a flat surface as though paint on canvas but in a translucent slide form with a quality of light and luminosity more associated as digital screen color, or more to the point, as a projected light image as configured for this dome installation.   Constructs:Conducts  The work is an immersive piece specifically composed for the Satosphere Dome. The audience is immersed in a color and sound space.  Each of Edmond’s visualized color hues (see figure 1) are assigned one overall tonal mass per image with minute shifts in timbral values and locative displacements.  When working on the score neucleosynthesis Greasley invited a trumpeter to blow a note at close proximity onto the open strings of a ‘prepared’ piano, allowing the strings to vibrate as they reflected the fundamental tone and harmonics of the source sound.  In the 18 Century Louis Betrand Castel experimented with the synaesthetic relationship of sound and color constructing a special Ocular Harpsichord, which on playing a specific key opened a curtain to reveal its color ground as luminous glass.       Figure 1. An image from Shaping Space by Edmonds at Site Gallery, Sheffield UK in 2013.  Although the starting point of this current project was to create an original sound palette from electronic synthesis, we use the human voice as a means of interpreting these synthetic forces  – particularly in experimenting with the wide timbral spectrum of the human instrument. And as part homage to Castel (and Cage), the aim is to interrogate the bel canto coloratura techniques of the soprano voice as a vocalizing source to excite and vibrate the strings of a ‘prepared harpsichord’.  This interaction between active and passive harmonics should evoke infinite tonal variations in color – auditory and visual.  These individual tones are carefully recorded and sampled and go towards compiling a comprehensive library of unique sound sources – a sonic color wheel from which to draw and blend multiple tones to form a specific color sound - each color sensation made up from single or multiple sound sources (up to maximum of 48).  Part of this project involves assigning each looped element to a single track of a multi-track recording device with up to a maximum of 96 different tone colors (faders) assignable per color image. By manipulating the fader controls on a mixer desk, each sound can be blended to create one overall color tone of evolving complexity. This mixing process is not unlike the draw-bar principle of a tone wheel organ, where each is manipulated to alter the harmonics of a single note. In addition, as every separate tone is assigned to a specific track, up to 96 can be individually spatialised within the 3D sound sphere.  This spatial mapping and dispersion of each point of sound within the sphere is critical in creating a perception of a space inhabited by sound, particularly where elements are assigned as ‘solo’ or collectively as a ‘sonic swarm’.  By treating elements to ‘flutter’, ‘hover’ or choreographed as pervasive points of audio, each sound assumes an identity or position within the cognitive boundaries of the audio field. A transient audience would be aware of individual tones placed laterally from mid to deep space, or vertically from ground to stratosphere. The overall effect is to create a sound color field as a living three dimensional medium within which a participator would be as one - both physically and emotionally, or as an internalized abstraction - an embodiment of human consciousness.

Unfortunately, humans'' most natural form of communication, speech, is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines – despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines'' ability to understand speech, the CHI community (and the HCI field at large) has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the unexpected variations in error rates when processing speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. As such, the development of interactive speech-based systems is mostly driven by engineering efforts to improve such systems with respect to largely arbitrary performance metrics. Such developments have often been void of any user-centered design principles or consideration for usability or usefulness.    The goal of this course is to inform the CHI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and speech synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms.

As a consequence, little is known about the self-tracking practices and needs of individuals living with mental illness. This understanding is important to guide the design of future tools to enable people to play a greater role in managing their health. In this article, we present a qualitative study focusing on the self-tracking practices of 10 people with bipolar disorder. We seek to understand the role self-tracking has played as they have come to grips with their diagnosis and attempted to self-manage their health. A central motivation for these participants is to identify risky patterns that may be harbingers of mood episodes, as well as positive trends that support recovery. What emerges is a fragmented picture of self-tracking, with no clear delineation between clinician-initiated and self-initiated practices, as well as considerable challenges participants face in making observations of themselves when their sense of self and emotional state is in flux, uncertain, and unreliable. Informed by these observations, we discuss the merits of a new form of self-tracking that combines manual and automated methods, addresses both clinician and individual needs, helps engage people with bipolar disorder in treatment, and seeks to overcome the significant challenges they face in self-monitoring.

Mobile devices support this form of interaction naturally, as the user can move the device closer or further away as needed. The current generation of mobile devices can employ computer vision, depth sensing and other inference methods to determine the distance between the user and the display. Once this distance is known, a system can adapt the rendering of display content accordingly and enable proximity-aware mobile interfaces. The dominant method of exploiting proximity-aware interfaces is to remove or superimpose visual information. In this paper, we investigate change blindness in such interfaces. We present the results of two experiments. In our first experiment we show that a proximity-aware mobile interface results in significantly more change blindness errors than a non-moving interface. The absolute difference in error rates was 13.7%.

In this work, we present a deep neural net to model and predict human performance in performing a sequence of UI tasks. In particular, we focus on a dominant class of tasks, i.e., target selection from a vertical list or menu. We experimented with our deep neural net using a public dataset collected from a desktop laboratory environment and a dataset collected from hundreds of touchscreen smartphone users via crowdsourcing. Our model significantly outperformed previous methods on these datasets. Importantly, our method, as a deep model, can easily incorporate additional UI attributes such as visual appearance and content semantics without changing model architectures. By understanding about how a deep learning model learns from human behaviors, our approach can be seen as a vehicle to discover new patterns about human behaviors to advance analytical modeling.', '');

INSERT INTO "content" VALUES (4935, 'SIGCHI Lifetime Research Award Talk—Seeing Past Looking Forward', 'I have long been interested in how computers can help people perform skilled tasks—a theme that underlies essentially all of my research. As the intentionally convoluted title of this talk implies, I will take a look back at some of this research to explain what came later, and to speculate on what might be next.    My earliest work as a graduate student was as part of a team developing novel hypermedia editing and presentation tools for technical documentation of equipment maintenance procedures. Understanding the effort involved in using these tools manually led to my dissertation, which explored rule-based techniques for the automated generation of 3D graphics that could ultimately replace the pictures found in maintenance manuals. Based on information about the task to be depicted, I designed a system that chose the objects to include, determined the level of detail at which to render them (e.g., adding more detail to disambiguate objects that could otherwise be confused with each other), highlighted important objects for emphasis, and created additional “metaobjects” (e.g., arrows to show actions). When I started as a faculty member, several of my students built on this research direction in both 3D and 2D domains, and we were soon collaborating with colleagues to develop generation approaches for coordinated multimedia explanations that combined graphics with text.    At the same time, I was becoming excited by the potential of virtual reality (VR) to render objects stereoscopically and interact with them in 3D, in abstract domains as well as physical ones. And it was an easy jump from there to augmented reality (AR), cobbling together a simple monoscopic optical see- through head-worn display. Our first AR system was a “hybrid” desktop window manager that embedded windows displayed on a flat panel display within a much larger virtual surround presented on the AR display. With that AR display now available as a tool, it became stunningly clear that so much of the effort we’d put into carefully crafting stand-alone pictures to explain tasks was unnecessary. If the user could instead look directly at the actual task domain, then a simple highlight or arrow, overlaid in situ, could show which button to push or knob to turn on a panel of controls.    Inspired by that observation, much of my lab’s research has since addressed the design of AR user interfaces, for users indoors and outdoors, working alone and together. While AR does make some problems easier, it introduces difficult challenges! In classical user interfaces, designers and programmers control essentially all of what users experience; for example, determining the color at every pixel, accounting in advance for a limited set of variations. In contrast, AR celebrates and must work in perceptual context with the physical world. And that world is supremely fluid, in ways that are often unpredictable, as users and things in their environment move and change relative to each other. In response, the virtual user interface must change dynamically, as needed, to complement rather than interfere with the physical world; for example, a less important virtual object shouldn’t obscure a more important object, whether physical or virtual.    Bearing this in mind and working not only in AR and VR, but in many kinds of desktop, mobile, and wearable user interfaces, my lab has tackled user interface design issues in domains such as healthcare, games, graphical editing, navigation, and equipment assembly. What comes next? I will conclude this talk by hazarding a few guesses (it is a dangerous sport!) about where some of this might lead.', '');

Indeed, the currently obtained workload classification accuracies are relatively low, making the resulting estimations not fully trustable. This paper thus studies promising modern machine learning algorithms, including Riemannian geometry-based methods and Deep Learning, to estimate workload from EEG signals.

Aiming to shed light on whether individual differences on visual behavior affect the strength of the created passwords, we conducted an eye-tracking study (N=36), and adopted an accredited cognitive style theory to interpret the results. The analysis revealed that users with different cognitive styles followed different patterns of visual behavior which affected the strength of the created passwords. Motivated, by the results of the first study, we introduced adaptive characteristics to the user authentication mechanism, aiming to assist specific cognitive style user groups to create more secure passwords, and conducted a second study with a new sample (N=40) to test the adaptive characteristics. Results strengthen our assumptions that adaptive mechanisms based on users’ differences in cognitive and visual behavior uncover a new perspective for improving the password’s strength within graphical user authentication realms.', '');

Our findings are based on a between-subjects experiment (n=272), in which we measured the impact of time since first publishing an OSN post on its sharing preferences. Our results quantify how willingness to share is lower for older Facebook posts, and show that older posts have lower relevancy to the user’s social network and are less representative of the user’s identity. We show that changes in the user’s social circles, the occurrence of significant life changes and a user’s young age are correlated with a further decrease in the willingness to keep sharing past information.

However, the limited physical space available for room-scale VR in the typical home or office environment poses a significant problem. To solve this, physical spaces can be extended by amplifying the mapping of physical to virtual movement (translational gain). Although amplified movement has been used since the earliest days of VR, little is known about how it influences reach-based interactions with virtual objects, now a standard feature of consumer VR. Consequently, this paper explores the picking and placing of virtual objects in VR for the first time, with translational gains of between 1x (a one-to-one mapping of a 3.5m*3.5m virtual space to the same sized physical space) and 3x (10.5m*10.5m virtual mapped to 3.5m*3.5m physical). Results show that reaching accuracy is maintained for up to 2x gain, however going beyond this diminishes accuracy and increases simulator sickness and perceived workload. We suggest gain levels of 1.5x to 1.75x can be utilized without compromising the usability of a VR task, significantly expanding the bounds of interactive room-scale VR.', '');

However, it is unknown how often users hold devices in a way that allows capturing their face or eyes, and how this impacts detection accuracy. We collected 25,726 in-the-wild photos, taken from the front-facing camera of smartphones as well as associated application usage logs.

This paper presents an exploratory look at the folk theory formation process and the interplay between folk theories and self-presentation via a 28-participant interview study. Results suggest that people draw from diverse sources of information when forming folk theories, and that folk theories are more complex, multifaceted and malleable than previously assumed.

Through conducting a field study and a follow-up survey of 47 graduate students, our research reveals gaps between a peer tutor''s strategy (i.e., question position and knowledge type) and a learner''s preference and answering effort. For example, compared to tutors, learners preferred that questions be inserted in the middle of the videos and that the answers to tacit knowledge-related questions be more numerous and longer than those for explicit knowledge-related questions.

A large part of the "inflexibility" comes from tight deadlines imposed on tasks, leaving workers little control over their work schedules. We experimentally examined the impact of offering workers control of their time in on-demand crowdwork. We found that granting higher "in-task flexibility" dramatically affected the temporal dynamics of worker behavior and produced a larger amount of work with similar quality. In a second experiment, we measured the compensating differential and found that workers would give up significant compensation to control their time, indicating workers attach substantial value to in-task flexibility. Our results suggest that designing tasks which give workers direct control of their time within tasks benefits both buyers and sellers of on-demand crowdwork.', '');

Such dynamic models are generative, estimating not only movement time, but also pointer position, velocity, and acceleration on a moment-to-moment basis. We describe an experimental framework for acquiring pointing actions and automatically fitting the parameters of mathematical models to the empirical data. We present the use of time-series, phase space, and Hooke plot visualisations of the experimental data, to gain insight into human pointing dynamics. We find that the identified control models can generate a range of dynamic behaviours that captures aspects of human pointing behaviour to varying degrees. Conditions with a low index of difficulty (ID) showed poorer fit because their unconstrained nature leads naturally to more behavioural variability. We report on characteristics of human surge behaviour (the initial, ballistic sub-movement) in pointing, as well as differences in a number of controller performance measures, including overshoot, settling time, peak time, and rise time. We describe trade-offs among the models. We conclude that control theory offers a promising complement to Fitts’ law based approaches in HCI, with models providing representations and predictions of human pointing dynamics, which can improve our understanding of pointing and inform design.', '');

While feedback is recognised as a key pedagogical dimension of these games, particularly in early learning, there has been no research on how commercial games available to schools and parents reify learning theory into feedback. Using a systematic content analysis, we examine how evidence-based feedback principles manifest in five widely-used learning games designed to foster young children’s reading skills. Our findings highlight strengths in how games deliver feedback when players succeed. Many of the games, however, were inconsistent and not proactive when providing error feedback, often promoting trial and error strategies. Furthermore, there was a lack of support for learning the game mechanics and a preference for task-oriented rewards less deeply embedded in the gameplay. Our research provides a design and research agenda for the inclusion of feedback in early learning games.', '');

With these videos, we aim to explore more complex interrelationships, using a thing-centered design perspective in a speculative way. To this end, we position things within entanglements: fluid assemblages formed and dissolved in a situated way. This shows new possibilities for everyday objects to co-perform tasks, and ‘carry’ information that can be interpreted further as new perspectives are gained through interaction. Additionally, as entanglements implies a complicated relationship, we aim to provoke a reflection on the conflicts that may arise between things, and the implications of them (mis)interpreting our behavior.

We implemented projected icons to prominently display game balancing mechanics in the AR table football game. In a within-subjects study (N=24), we found players prefer skill-based control over game balancing and that different triggers are perceived as having different fairness. Further, the study showed that even game balancing that is perceived as unfair can provide enjoyable game experiences.

While this has led to an increase in the potential application domains of crowdsourcing and human computation, problems that require machine-level speeds---on the order of milliseconds, not seconds---have remained out of reach because of the fundamental bounds of human perception and response time. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to exceed these bounds by combining human and machine intelligence. We introduce the look-ahead approach, a hybrid intelligence workflow that enables instantaneous crowdsourcing systems (i.e., those that can return crowd responses within mere milliseconds). The look-ahead approach works by exploring possible future states that may be encountered within a short time horizon (e.g., a few seconds into the future) and prefetching crowd worker responses to these states. We validate the efficacy and explore the limitations of our approach on the Bolt system, which consists of an arcade-style game (Lightning Dodger) that we formally model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). When the MDP reward function is unspecified---as in many real-world tasks---the look-ahead approach enables just-in-time (JIT) training of the agent''s policy function. Through a series of crowd worker experiments, we demonstrate that the look-ahead approach can outperform the fastest individual worker by approximately two orders of magnitude. Our work opens new avenues for hybrid intelligence systems that are as smart as people, but also far faster than humanly possible.  ', '');

An Exploratory Study', 'Usability and user experience (UX) issues are often not well emphasized and addressed in open source software (OSS) development. There is an imperative need for supporting OSS communities to collaboratively identify, understand, and fix UX design issues in a distributed environment. In this paper, we provide an initial step towards this effort and report on an exploratory study that investigated how the OSS communities currently reported, discussed, negotiated, and eventually addressed usability and UX issues. We conducted in-depth qualitative analysis of selected issue tracking threads from three OSS projects hosted on GitHub. Our findings indicated that discussions about usability and UX issues in OSS communities were largely influenced by the personal opinions and experiences of the participants. Moreover, the characteristics of the community may have greatly affected the focus of such discussion.', '');

This is complemented by teachers'' immediate and explicit feedback.  Interactive tools that provide explicit feedback during collaborative learning are scarce, however. More commonly, supporting dialogue practice takes the form of computer-aided single-student read-and-record activities. This limitation is partly due to the complexity of processing language learners'' speech in unconstrained tasks. In this paper, we assess the value of pronunciation error detection algorithms within a realistic, software-aided, paired role-playing task with beginning learners of French. We found that students'' pronunciations improve regardless of the type of error detector employed -- even for those using simple heuristics. We suggest that speech technologies for language learning have been too focused on engineering goals. Instead, new interactive designs supporting collaboration may be used to overcome engineering limitations and properly support students'' engagement.', '');

The questions remain, however, as to the impact of these new platforms on social dynamics within OHCs and their well-being. To examine these questions, we qualitatively studied a migration of a popular OHC, focusing on diabetes self-management, between two off-the-shelf social computing platforms. Despite improving information management, the migration served as a catalyst to reveal the importance of features for identity management and closed circle communication that were not apparent to either the management or the membership of the community.

Though promising, such methods require people to map their design ideas--often unintuitively--to a small number of mathematical input parameters, and the relationship between those parameters and a generated design is often unclear, making it difficult to iterate a design. We present Forte, a sketch-based, real-time interactive tool for people to directly express and iterate on their designs via 2D topology optimization. Users can ask the system to add structures, provide a variation with better performance, or optimize internal material layouts. Users can globally control how much to `deviate'' from the initial sketch, or perform local suggestive editing, which interactively prompts the system to update based on the new information. Design sessions with 10 participants demonstrate that Forte empowers designers to create and explore a range of optimized designs with custom forms and styles.', '');

Depending on the experimental condition, they received different information about the audience size and viewing notifications intended to increase a sense of personal responsibility in bystanders. Results indicated that bystanders were more likely to intervene indirectly than directly, and information about the audience size and viewership increased the likelihood of flagging cyberbullying posts through serial mediation of public surveillance, accountability, and personal responsibility.

GridDrones consists of 15 cube-shaped nanocopters that can be placed in a volumetric 1xnxn mid-air grid. Grid deformations can be applied interactively to this voxel lattice by first selecting a set of voxels using a 3D wand, then assigning a continuous topological relationship between voxel sets that determines how voxels move in relation to each other, then drawing out selected voxels from the lattice structure. Using this simple technique, it is possible to create overhanging structures that can be translated and oriented freely in 3D. Shape transformations can also be recorded to allow for simple physical shape morphing animations. This work extends previous work on selection and editing techniques for 3D user interfaces.', '');

The results show that the overview facilitated decision- and sensemaking during a collaborative trip-planning task by aiding groups to iterate their itinerary, organize locations and timings efficiently, and discover new insights. Groups shared and discussed more opinions, resulting in more democratic decision-making.

We developed two typefaces to assess the quality of legibility for use on E-ink displays in an educational or business environment, using the typeface Arial as a standard. Legibility is measured in terms of how many correct words the subject reads aloud and the time taken to initially speak. Time is not used to assess reading speeds, but to establish difficulty in legibility. Three different font sizes are used to determine any lower bound thresholds on legibility that exist within the typeface. These methods allow for a font to be developed and used with E-ink displays for clear communication.  ', '');

To support these decision-making tasks, which may require elastic prioritization of goals dependent on changing conditions, custom analytics tools are often developed. We were asked to develop such a tool by a team at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where rover telecom operators make decisions based on models predicting how much data rovers can transfer from the surface of Mars. Through research, design, implementation, and informal evaluation of our new tool, we developed principles to inform the design of visual analytics systems in operations contexts. We offer these principles as a step towards understanding the complex task of designing these systems. The principles we present are applicable to designers and developers tasked with building analytics systems in domains that face complex operations challenges such as scheduling, routing, and logistics.', '');

One common approach is to encode data values and uncertainty values independently, using two visual variables. These resulting bivariate maps can be difficult to interpret, and interference between visual channels can reduce the discriminability of marks. To address this issue, we contribute Value-Suppressing Uncertainty Palettes (VSUPs). VSUPs allocate larger ranges of a visual channel to data when uncertainty is low, and smaller ranges when uncertainty is high. This non-uniform budgeting of the visual channels makes more economical use of the limited visual encoding space when uncertainty is low, and encourages more cautious decision-making when uncertainty is high. We demonstrate several examples of VSUPs, and present a crowdsourced evaluation showing that, compared to traditional bivariate maps, VSUPs encourage people to more heavily weight uncertainty information in decision-making tasks.', '');

The user makes quick hand motions in the air to generate approximate 3D shapes, and uses them as scaffolds on which to add details via pen-based 3D sketching on a tablet device. Our air scaffolding technique and corresponding algorithm extract only the intended shapes from unconstrained hand motions. Then, the user sketches 3D ideas by defining sketching planes on these scaffolds while appending new scaffolds, as needed.

But most commercial energy monitors draw on economic behavioral models that render residents as rational decision makers who seek to save money on their next energy bill. The more recent research in academia is grounded in social psychology suggesting that prospective energy conservationists are driven by social norms. These individualist perspectives have failed to address the potential of leveraging social behavioral theories to design technologically mediated feedback that enhances individuals’ awareness of and willingness to cooperate with the wider digitally interconnected social collective. This research addresses this gap by testing how particular visual structures of feedback graphs increase collective awareness and cooperation in the home energy-monitoring context.

While training accurate person- and device-independent gaze estimators remains challenging, person-specific training is feasible but requires tedious data collection for each target device. To address these limitations, we present the first method to train person-specific gaze estimators across multiple devices. At the core of our method is a single convolutional neural network with shared feature extraction layers and device-specific branches that we train from face images and corresponding on-screen gaze locations. Detailed evaluations on a new dataset of interactions with five common devices (mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer, smart TV) and three common applications (mobile game, text editing, media center) demonstrate the significant potential of cross-device training. We further explore training with gaze locations derived from natural interactions, such as mouse or touch input.', '');

To do so, we design three interfaces for a shared lighting system that vary in the type of social information they allow people to share with others and in their overall interaction style. We systematically compare longitudinal and real-life use of the interfaces, evaluating (1) people’s appraisal of three types of social information and (2) the influence of an interaction style on coordination of shared use.

The resulting interaction has compelling properties, as users are guided by motion feedback, and only need to copy a presented motion. Motion correlation has been explored in earlier work but only recently begun to feature in holistic interface designs. We provide a first comprehensive review of the principle, and present an analysis of five previously published works, in which motion correlation underpinned the design of novel gaze and gesture interfaces for diverse application contexts.

Non-decomposition is a property of certain types of complex problems, like the formulation of an R&D approach or the definition of a research methodology, which cannot be handled through the “divide and conquer” approach typically used in micro-task crowdsourcing. In contrast to splitting the macrotask to multiple microtasks and allocating them to several workers in parallel, our model supports the sequential improvement of the macrotask one worker at a time, across distinct time slots of a given timeline, until a sufficient quality level is achieved. Our model assumes an online environment where expert workers are available only at specific time slots and worker/task arrivals are not known a priori. With respect to this setting, we propose TAS-ONLINE, an online algorithm that aims to complete as many tasks as possible within budget, required quality and a given timeline, without any future input information regarding job release dates or worker availabilities. Experimental results comparing TAS-ONLINE to five benchmarks show that it achieves more completed jobs, lower flow times and higher job quality. This work bears practical implications for providing performance and quality guarantees to expert crowdsourcing platforms that wish to integrate non-decomposable macrotasks into their offered services.', '');

When such difficulties occur, individuals often rely on more knowledgeable users to overcome difficulties. However, many do not have a support network of knowledgeable individuals available. Moreover, some challenges go beyond the need for guidance, as for example difficulties in performing swipes for motor impaired people. In this paper, we propose Data Donors, a conceptual framework proposing the enablement of users with the capacity to help others to do so by donating their mobile interaction data and knowledge. Inspired by charitable donations, we outline the Data Donors framework and discuss three applications that are being developed under the data donning paradigm.

However, our formative study of 962 Thingiverse models shows a lack of re-use of models, perhaps due to the advanced skills needed for 3D modeling. An end user program perspective on 3D modeling is needed. Our framework (PARTs) empowers amateur modelers to graphically specify design intent through geometry. PARTs includes a GUI, scripting API and exemplar library of assertions which test design expectations and integrators which act on intent to create geometry. PARTs lets modelers integrate advanced, model specific functionality into designs, so that they can be re-used and extended, without programming. In two workshops, we show that PARTs helps to create 3D printable models, and modify existing models more easily than with a standard tool.', '');

This perspective of disagreement translates to diverse coding contexts and groups of coders irrespective of discipline. We introduce two tree-based ranking metrics as standardized ways of comparing disagreements in how data instances have been coded.

Many online tools solicit public input, yet typically limit interaction to collecting complaints or early-stage ideas. This paper explores how to engage the public in more complex stages of urban design without requiring a significant time commitment. After observing workshops, we designed a system called CommunityCrit that offers micro-activities to engage communities in elaborating and evaluating urban design ideas. Through a four-week deployment, in partnership with a local planning group seeking to redesign a street intersection, CommunityCrit yielded 352 contributions (around 10 minutes per participant). The planning group reported that CommunityCrit provided insights on public perspectives and raised awareness for their project, but noted the importance of setting expectations for the process. People appreciated that the system provided a window into the planning process, empowered them to contribute, and supported diverse levels of skills and availability.', '');

In order to enhance immersion in the virtual world, researchers have since pursued the addition of movement and haptics through motion platforms, exoskeletons, and other hand-held devices. From a proliferation of low-cost devices that can sense the user''s motion to full body motion capture suits, from gloves to gestures, natural interaction techniques have been desirable and explored in HCI and VR for several years. With virtual reality rapidly becoming accessible to mass audiences, there is growing interest in new forms of natural input techniques to enhance immersion and engagement in multiuser systems. First we need to determine what types of techniques can we design that would integrate well with multiuser experiences. Next, we need to understand the contribution of the designed techniques to the experience, understand how they work with existing controllers, and explore whether they should replace or augment current techniques in order to design more effective and engaging experiences. Finally, it is vital to discern the limitations and the types of application scenarios that are suitable for incorporating the techniques. The aim of this workshop is to deepen and expand the discussion on natural interaction techniques for collaborative VR within the CHI community and promote their relevance and research in HCI.', '');

However, their inherent limitations have hampered wider adoption. 3D sketching using hand motion is rapid but rough, and 3D sketching using pen drawing is delicate but tedious. Our new 3D sketching workflow combines these two in a complementary manner. The user makes quick hand motions in the air to generate approximate 3D shapes, and uses them as scaffolds on which to add details via pen-based 3D sketching on a tablet device. Our air scaffolding technique and corresponding algorithm extract only the intended shapes from unconstrained hand motions. Then, the user sketches 3D ideas by defining sketching planes on these scaffolds while appending new scaffolds, as needed. Our progressive and iterative workflow enables more agile 3D sketching compared to ones using either hand motion or pen drawing alone.', '');

Recent work suggests that accuracy can be improved by compensating systematic offsets between targets a user aims at and rays cast from the user to the target. In this paper, we investigate mid-air pointing in the real world and virtual reality. Through a pointing study, we model the offsets to improve pointing accuracy and show that being in a virtual environment affects how users point at targets. In the second study, we validate the developed model and analyze the effect of compensating systematic offsets. We show that the provided model can significantly improve pointing accuracy when no cursor is provided.

After testing four prototypes using Bluetooth, NFC, and a microcontroller we accomplished almost full compliance and high acceptance using a paper diary to track day-to-day fluctuations over 49 days. This diary is tailored to each patient''s condition, does not require any handwriting, allows for implicit reminders, provides recording flexibility, and its answers can be encoded automatically. We share five design implications for future Parkinson''s self-reporting artefacts: reduce participant completion demand, design to offset the effect of tremor on input, enable implicit reminders, design for positive and negative consequences of increased awareness of symptoms, and consider the effects of handwritten notes in compliance, encoding burden, and data quality.

Serious games—games that motivate behaviour and retain attention in serious contexts — can change the attitudes, behaviours, and habits of players. These games for change have been shown to motivate behaviour change, persuade people, and promote learning using various persuasive strategies. However, persuasive strategies that motivate one player may demotivate another. In this article, we show the importance of tailoring games for change in the context of a game designed to improve healthy eating habits. We tailored a custom-designed game by adapting only the persuasive strategies employed; the game mechanics themselves did not vary. Tailoring the game design to players’ personality type improved the effectiveness of the games in promoting positive attitudes, intention to change behaviour, and self-efficacy. Furthermore, we show that the benefits of tailoring the game intervention are not explained by the improved player experience, but directly by the choice of persuasive strategy employed. Designers and researchers of games for change can use our results to improve the efficacy of their game-based interventions.   ', '');

Our inquiry is driven with SwitchBot, a conversational bot which engages with workers at the start and end of their work day. After preliminarily validating the design of a detachment and reattachment dialogue frame-work with 108 crowdworkers, we study SwitchBot’s use in-situ for 14 days with 34 information workers. We find that workers send fewer e-mails after work hours and spend a larger percentage of their first hour at work using productivity applications than they normally would when using SwitchBot.

Using prior research on empathy, we considered the emotional drivers of empathy and examined how campaigns convey those emotions using campaign pictures and language. We analyzed the facial expressions in campaign pictures and the emotional words in the campaign language, and we found that emotions shape fundraising success.

An alternative is to place 360 video cameras around an event space to capture footage passively and then extract regular field-of-view (RFOV) shots for the summary. This paper focuses on the problem of extracting such RFOV shots. Since we cannot actively control the cameras or the scene, it is hard to create ``ideal'''' shots that adhere strictly to traditional cinematography rules. To better understand the tradeoffs, we study human preferences for static and moving camera RFOV shots generated from 360 footage. From the findings, we derive design guidelines.

To examine this difference further, we conducted another experiment where participants were exposed to both attitude-consistent and attitude-inconsistent campaigns with varying levels of social support.

This paper therefore proposes two approaches to game selection: the first leverages online videogame databases and existing PX research, and is structured with respect to widely-applicable videogame metadata. The second process applies established game design theory to serve researchers when insufficient connections between desired PX outcomes and recognisable game elements exist. Both methods are accompanied by example reports of their application.

In this paper, we explore how to best support users in remixing a specific class of 3D printed objects, namely those that perform mechanical functions.    In our survey, we found that makers remix such machines by manually extracting parts from one parent model and combine it with parts from a different parent model. This approach often puts axles made by one maker into bearings made by another maker or combines a gear by one maker with a gear by a different maker. This approach is problem-atic, however, as parts from different makers tend to fit poorly, which results in long series of tweaks and test-prints until all parts finally work together.    We address this with our interactive system grafter. Grafter does two things. First, grafter largely automates the process of extracting and recombining mechanical elements from 3D printed machines. Second, it enforces a more efficient approach to reuse: it prevents users from extracting indi-vidual parts, but instead affords extracting groups of me-chanical elements that already work together, such as axles and their bearings or pairs of gears. We call this mecha-nism-based remixing. In a final user study, all models that participants had remixed using grafter could be 3D printed without further tweaking and worked immediately.  ', '');

Viewers felt more satisfied with their feed when controls were present, whether they worked or not. We also examine how people engage in sensemaking around control settings, finding that users often take responsibility for violated expectations -- for both real and randomly functioning controls. Finally, we studied how users controlled their social media feeds in the wild. The use of existing social media controls had little impact on user''s satisfaction with the feed; instead, users often turned to improvised solutions, like scrolling quickly, to see what they want.

Our method is based on an interactive adaptation of the feedforward method: a psychophysical training technique achieving rapid improvement in performance by exposing participants to self models showing previously unachieved performance levels. We evaluated our method in a cycling-based exergame. Participants competed against (i) a self model which represented their previous speed; (ii) a self model representing their previous speed but increased resistance therefore requiring higher performance to keep up; or (iii) a virtual competitor at the same two levels of performance.

Due to their conversational character, chatbots are potentially effective tools for engaging with customers, and are often developed with commercial interests at the core.  However, chatbots also represent opportunities for positive social impact. Chatbots can make needed services more accessible, available, and affordable. They can strengthen users'' autonomy, competence, and (possibly counter-intuitively) social relatedness.    In this SIG we address the possible social benefits of chatbots and conversational user interfaces. We will bring together the existing, but disparate, community of researchers and practitioners within the CHI community and broader fields who have an interest in chatbots. We aim to discuss the potential for chatbots to move beyond their assumed role as channels for commercial service providers, explore how they may be used for social good, and how the HCI community may contribute to realize this.', '');

As several tasks require multiple expertise, a designer may integrate multiple chatbots in the background or include them as interlocutors in a conversation. We investigated both scenarios by means of a Wizard of Oz experiment, in which participants talked to chatbots about visiting a destination. We analyzed the conversation content, users’ speech, and reported impressions. We found no significant difference between single- and multi-chatbots scenarios. However, even with equivalent conversation structures, users reported more confusion in multi-chatbots interactions and adopted strategies to organize turn-taking. Our findings indicate that implementing a meta-chatbot may not be necessary, since similar conversation structures occur when interacting to multiple chatbots, but different interactional aspects must be considered for each scenario.', '');

This process does not scale well, and graph layout algorithms lack the biological underpinnings to offer a viable alternative. In this paper, we present CrowdLayout, a crowdsourcing system that leverages human intelligence and creativity to design layouts of biological network visualizations. CrowdLayout provides design guidelines, abstractions, and editing tools to help novice workers perform like experts. We evaluated CrowdLayout in two experiments with paid crowd workers and real biological network data, finding that crowds could both create and evaluate meaningful, high-quality layouts.

We hypothesize that by developing programming languages and environments that align with how manual artists work, we can build procedural systems that enhance, rather than displace10, manual art. To explore this, we developed Dynamic Brushes, a programming and drawing environment motivated by interviews with artists. Dynamic Brushes enables the creation of ad-hoc drawing tools that transform stylus inputs to procedural patterns. Applications range from transforming individual strokes to behaviors that draw multiple strokes simultaneously, respond to temporal events, and leverage external data. Results from an extended evaluation with artists provide guidelines for learnable, expressive systems that blend manual and procedural creation.', 'BEST_PAPER');

This object’s surface also guides the finger’s movement, creating an implicit motion-to-vibration mapping. If we wish to simulate a texture in mid-air, such guidance does not exist, making the choice of motion-to-vibration mapping non-obvious. We evaluate the experience of moving a pointer with four different motion-to vibration mappings in an interview study. We found that some mappings lead to a perception shift, transforming the experience. When this occurs, the pointer is no longer perceived as vibrating, interactions become more pleasurable, and users have an increased experience of agency and control.

The model fits the empirical data well with 0.95 and 0.94 R2 values for μ and σ, respectively. We also demonstrated two extensions of the model, including 1) predicting error rates in moving target selection; and 2) a novel interaction technique to implicitly aid moving target selection. By applying them in a game interface design, we observed good performances in both predicting error rates (e.g., 2.7% mean absolute error) and assisting moving target selection (e.g., 33% or a greater increase in pointing accuracy).', '');

Imagine someone breathing raggedly: are they nervous, or excited?       To assess the premise that irregular breathing connotes low valence (emotion negativity), we implemented different levels of breathing variability and complexity in simple furry robots. We asked 10 participants to watch and feel the behaviors, rate their valence, and explain their impressions. While a quantitative exploration of new and previous data showed correlation between multi-scale entropy and valence, the rich narratives revealed by thematic analysis of participant explanations call into question whether a single motion can, alone, be unambiguously valenced.

Cortana, as well as Google Home, Amazon Echo, and others, can provide support for various tasks from managing reminders to booking a hotel. However, with few exceptions, user input is limited to explicit queries or commands. In this work, we explore the role of implicit conversational cues in guided task completion scenarios. In a Wizard of Oz study, we found that, for the task of cooking a recipe, nearly one-quarter of all user-assistant exchanges were initiated from implicit conversational cues rather than from plain questions. Given that these implicit cues occur in such high frequency, we conclude by presenting a set of design implications for the design of guided task experiences in contemporary conversational assistants.', '');

However, two concerns signal a pause for reflection and change. First, while mobiles have rapidly become indispensable, the effect that constant device use has on our lives, our experiences, and the interactions we have with others, has caused growing discomfort. At the same time, there is a broad sense that mainstream mobile devices have fallen into a period of innovation limbo, with recent releases seemingly being distinguished only by ever narrowing feature gaps. As a recent Economist article bleakly reports, ‘‘More black rectangles made their debut”.    This course will challenge attendees to play a part in reinvigorating mobile interaction design. We celebrate the success that is apps, services, and the hugely popular ecology of mobile devices, but want to promote a return to radical innovation.    We have been fortunate enough to have collaborated with a broad range of industrial and academic researchers and practitioners over many years. More importantly, however, we have worked with a wide range of people who are not considered to be typical  “future makers,” and are also not usually considered when designing mobile user experiences. Typically these people—who have been called “emergent” users—are often drawn from developing regions, with lower literacy, lower socioeconomic conditions, and other constraints. Our experience in working with these people has demonstrated how their unique and contrasting outlooks on both technology and the world and ways of seeing it are invaluable in generating radically new and exciting digital innovations.', '');

A common strategy is to let the user initiate the service request (e.g., “click here to receive coupons for your favorite products”), a practice known as “overt personalization.” Another strategy is to assuage users’ privacy concerns by being transparent about how their data would be collected, utilized and stored. To test these two strategies, we conducted a 2 (Personalization: Overt vs. Covert) x 2 (Transparency: High vs. Low) factorial experiment, with a fifth control condition. Participants (N=302) interacted with GreenByMe, a prototype of an eco-friendly mobile application. Data show that overt personalization affects perceived control. Significant three-way interactions between power usage, perceived overt personalization and perceived information transparency was seen on perceived ease of use, trust in the app, user engagement and behavioral intention to use the app in the future. In addition, results reveal that perceived information transparency also promotes trust, which is negatively linked with privacy concerns and positively correlated with user engagement and product involvement.', '');

In this paper, we first quantify and describe the speech recognition errors that users are prone to miss, and investigate how to better support this error identification task by manipulating pauses between words, speech rate, and speech repetition. To achieve these goals, we conducted a series of four studies. Study 1, an in-lab study, showed that participants missed identifying over 50% of speech recognition errors when listening to audio output of the recognized text. Building on this result, Studies 2 to 4 were conducted using an online crowdsourcing platform and showed that adding a pause between words improves error identification compared to no pause, the ability to identify errors degrades with higher speech rates (300 WPM), and repeating the speech output does not improve error identification.

If it can be reduced to some extend, latency can also be compensated through software compensation by trying to predict the future position of the cursor based on previous positions, velocities and accelerations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid hardware and software prediction technique specifically designed for partially compensating end-to-end latency in indirect pointing. We combine a computer mouse with a high frequency accelerometer to predict the future location of the pointer using Euler based equations. Our prediction method results in more accurate prediction than previously introduced prediction algorithms for direct touch.

Fiction has long played a part in design research in the form of scenarios, personas, sketches, paper based prototypes, simulations, prototypes and speculative design. The term “design fiction” has been recently adopted to describe more elaborate and detailed representations of products and services that do not exist yet. Design fiction is an emerging practice and there are several competing definitions and forms. This article traces design fiction from the Italian radical design of the 1960s through British Art Schools in the late nineteen nineties to contemporary adaptations of the practice by companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook. Design fiction is now produced regularly by individuals launching Kickstarter campaigns, corporations selling visions of future products and governments imagining new digital services. But there is little agreement about the status of such fictions: what constitutes a good fiction? How does fiction relate to research? In what sense does fiction contribute to existing knowledge? Although fiction can sometimes result in accurate prediction this is not its main value. It is rather the creation of ambiguous artefacts that help us think carefully about emerging technologies and their potential impact. Although fiction may seem to be the antithesis of empirical enquiry it is often employed in the form of “thought experiments” in Physics, Mathematics, Ethics and Philosophy. This article argues that design fiction can also be considered as a form of thought experiment. Excerpts from a fictional Wikipedia article about Valdis Ozols, a Lativian Historian and author writing design fiction in the 1940s precede each section as think pieces about the nature and value of fiction. The text is illustrated with pages from a fictional design workbook written in an invented language.   ', '');

We created a block-based interface for programming a one-armed industrial robot and conducted a study with 67 adult novices comparing it to two programming approaches in widespread use in industry. The results show participants using the block-based interface successfully implemented robot programs faster with no loss in accuracy while reporting higher scores for usability, learnability, and overall satisfaction. The contribution of this work is showing the potential for using block-based programming to make powerful technologies accessible to a wider audience.', 'HONORABLE_MENTION');

Scrollable two-dimensional grids are a common user interface on mobile devices that allow users to access a large number of items on a small screen by direct touch. By analyzing touch input and eye gaze of users during grid interaction, we reveal how multiple performance components come into play in such a task, including navigation, visual search and pointing. These findings inspired us to design a novel predictive model that combines these components for modeling grid tasks. We realized these model components by employing both traditional analytical methods and data-driven machine learning approaches. In addition to showing high accuracy achieved by our model in predicting human performance on a test dataset, we demonstrate how such a model can lead to a significant reduction in interaction time when used in a predictive user interface.', '');

In this study, we seek to understand the significance of these tattoos in the context of survivorship. We interviewed 19 cancer survivors about their survivor tattoos, exploring the benefits of designing, discussing, and displaying these tattoos as elements of emotional recovery post-cancer. We found that the act of designing a survivor tattoo facilitated all three elements of post-traumatic growth processes, including: (1) changed self-perception; (2) changed sense of relationships with others; and (3) changed philosophy of life. Through participants’ lived experiences, we discuss information about emotions, health, and recovery encoded in tattoos, and provide implications for tools to help future cancer survivors recover from the trauma of diagnosis and treatment.', 'HONORABLE_MENTION');

In such scenarios, when compared to the real world audio cues are often impoverished. As a result, users cannot rely on subtle spatial audio-visual cues that guide attention and enable effective social interactions in real-world situations. We explored whether gaze-contingent audio enhancement techniques driven by inferring audio-visual attention in virtual displays could be used to enable effective communication in cluttered audio virtual environments. In all of our experiments, we hypothesized that visual attention could be used as a tool to modulate the quality and intensity of sounds from multiple sources to efficiently and naturally select spatial sound sources. For this purpose, we built a gaze-contingent display that allowed tracking of a user''s gaze in real-time and modifying the volume of the speakers'' voices contingent on the current region of overt attention. We compared six different techniques for sound modulation with a base condition providing no attentional modulation of sound. The techniques were compared in terms of source recognition and preference in a set of user studies. Overall, we observed that users liked the ability to control the sounds with their eyes. They felt that a rapid change in attenuation with attention but not the elimination of competing sounds (partial rather than absolute selection) was most natural. In conclusion, audio gaze-contingent displays offer potential for simulating rich, natural social and other interactions in virtual environments. They should be considered for improving both performance and fidelity in applications related to social behaviour scenarios or when the user needs to work with multiple audio sources of information.', '');

These maps are widely used by experts and lay citizens alike for communicating scientific and geographical data. A critical challenge for designers of these maps is selecting a color scheme that is both effective and aesthetically pleasing. Although there exist empirically grounded guidelines for color choice in segmented maps (e.g., choropleths), continuous maps are significantly understudies, and their color-coding guidelines are largely based on expert opinion and design heuristics--many of these guidelines have yet to be verified experimentally. We conducted a series of crowdsourced experiments to investigate how the perception of continuous maps is affected by colormap characteristics and spatial frequency (a measure of data complexity). We find that spatial frequency significantly impacts the effectiveness of color encodes, but the precise effect is task-dependent. While rainbow schemes afforded the highest accuracy in quantity estimation irrespective of spatial complexity, divergent colormaps significantly outperformed other schemes in tasks requiring the perception of high-frequency patterns. We interpret these results in relation to current practices, and devise new and more granular guidelines for color mapping in continuous maps.', '');

Unfortunately, humans'' most natural form of communication, speech, is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines – despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines'' ability to understand speech, the CHI community (and the HCI field at large) has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the unexpected variations in error rates when processing speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. As such, the development of interactive speech-based systems is mostly driven by engineering efforts to improve such systems with respect to largely arbitrary performance metrics. Such developments have often been void of any user-centered design principles or consideration for usability or usefulness.    The goal of this course is to inform the CHI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and speech synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms.

Our focus on various types of social support in a live streaming masspersonal platform adds a more detailed understanding to the existing literature of mediated social support. Furthermore, it suggests potential directions for designing more supportive and interactive live streaming platforms.', '');

While most systems include and make use of the possibility to create tactile feedback through vibration, kinesthetic feedback systems almost exclusively rely on external mechanical hardware to induce actual sensations so far. In this paper, we describe an approach to create a feeling of such sensations by using unmodified off-the-shelf hardware and a software solution for a multi-modal pseudo-haptics approach. We first explore this design space by applying user-elicited methods, and afterwards evaluate our refined solution in a user study. The results show that it is indeed possible to communicate kinesthetic feedback by visual and tactile cues only and even induce its perception. While visual clipping was generally unappreciated, our approach led to significant increases of enjoyment and presence.', '');

This addition creates the illusion of a virtual object that is physically hitting or pushing the smartwatch, from within the device itself. Using this approach, we extend virtual space and scenes into a 2D physical space. To create realistic lateral force feedback, we first examined the minimum change in force magnitude that is detectable by users in different directions and weight levels, finding an average JND of 49% across all tested conditions, with no significant effect of weight and force direction. We then developed a proof-of-concept hardware prototype called Jetto and demonstrated its unique capabilities through a set of impact-enhanced videos and games. Our preliminary user evaluations indicated the concept was welcomed and is regarded as a worthwhile addition to smartwatch output and media experiences.', '');

We found that BubbleView clicks can both (i) successfully approximate eye fixations on different images, and (ii) be used to rank image and design elements by importance. BubbleView is designed to collect clicks on static images, and works best for defined tasks such as describing the content of an information visualization or measuring image importance.

While online news comments sections offer space for pluralist and critical discussion, studies suggest that this rarely occurs. Motivated by common practices of annotating, defacing and scribbling on physical newspapers, we built a mobile app – Newsr – that supports co-annotation, in the form of graffiti, on online news articles, which we evaluated in-the-wild for one month. We report on how the app encouraged participants to reflect upon the act of choosing news stories, whilst promoting exploration, the critique of content, and the exposure of bias within the writing.

Little social and practical benefits have emerged so far. IoT devices, so-called smart objects, are becoming even more pervasive and social, leading to the need to provide non-technical users with innovative interaction strategies for controlling their behavior. In other words, the opportunities offered by IoT can be amplified if new approaches are conceived to enable non-technical users to be directly involved in “composing” their smart objects by synchronizing their behavior. To fulfill this goal, this article introduces a model that includes new operators for defining rules combining multiple events and conditions exposed by smart objects, and  for defining temporal and spatial constraints on rule activation. The article also presents the results of an elicitation study that was conducted to identify possible visual paradigms for expressing composition rules. Prototypes implementing the resulting visual paradigms were compared during a controlled experiment and the one that resulted most relevant for our goals was used in a study that involved home-automation experts. Finally, the article discusses some design implications that came out from the performed studies and presents the architecture of a platform supporting rule definition and execution.', '');

This article investigates several factors that may influence whether use of an expert technique persists when the context of use changes. Two studies examine the effect of changing performance requirements, and find that a high performance requirement imposed in a training context can effectively push users to adopt an expert technique, and that use of the technique is maintained when the requirement is subsequently reduced or removed. In a final study, performance requirement, high-level task, and environment of use are changed—participants played a training game to learn the menu for a drawing application, which they then used to complete a series of drawings over the following week. Participants exhibited a somewhat surprising “all-or-nothing” effect, using the expert technique nearly exclusively or not at all, and maintaining this behavior over a range of qualitatively different tasks. This suggests that switching to an expert technique involves a global change by the user, rather than an incremental change as suggested by previous work.', '');

This paper is the first to formally define this problem and propose an algorithmic method to support designers to explore alternative functionality sets in early stage design. Based on interviews of professional designers, we mathematically define the task of identifying functionality sets that strike the best balance among four objectives: usefulness, satisfaction, ease of use, and profitability. We develop an integer linear programming solution that can efficiently solve very large instances (set size over 1,300) on a regular computer. Further, we build on techniques of robust optimization to search for diverse and surprising functionality designs. Empirical results from a controlled study and field deployment are encouraging.

HCI researchers use a range of methods for interpreting the `full range of human experience'' from qualitative data, however, such approaches are not always scalable. Feminist geography seeks to explore how diverse and varied accounts of place can be understood and represented, whilst avoiding reductive classification systems. In this paper, we assess the extent to which unsupervised topic models can support such a research agenda.    Drawing on literature from Feminist and Critical GIS, we present a case study analysis of a Volunteered Geographic Information dataset of reviews about breastfeeding in public spaces. We demonstrate that topic modelling can offer novel insights and nuanced interpretations of complex concepts such as privacy and be integrated into a critically reflexive feminist data analysis approach that captures and represents diverse experiences of place.

Over two years, we recruited 1999 participants to fill out a survey on emergent S&P news events. We identified four types of S&P news: financial data breaches, corporate personal data breaches, high sensitivity systems breaches, and politicized / activist cybersecurity. These event types strongly correlated with how people shared S&P news—e.g., financial data breaches were shared most (42%), while politicized / activist cybersecurity events were shared least (21%). Furthermore, participants’ age, gender and security behavioral intention strongly correlated with how they heard about and shared S&P news—e.g., males more often felt a personal responsibility to share, and older people were less likely to hear about S&P news through conversation.', '');

Actionable Analytics and Targeted Reflection for Emotional Well-Being', 'We explore the Examined Life, informing the design of reflective systems to promote emotional well-being, a critical health issue. People now have increasingly rich, digital records of highly personal data about what they said, did, and felt in the past. But social science research shows that people have difficulty in tracking and regulating their emotions. New reflective technologies that promote constructive analysis of rich personal data potentially offer transformative ways that individuals might better understand themselves and improve well-being. However, there are important system design challenges in supporting effective reflection about personal data. We explore fidelity in recording and representing past personal mood data, and forecasting future actions, feelings, and thoughts. Much prior personal informatics work has been dedicated to past-centric tools for recording and capture. In contrast, forecasting examines how we might use such past data to inform and motivate our future selves, providing recommendations about remedial actions to improve future well-being. Fidelity addresses both how and what reflective systems should show people about their pasts, in particular whether we should filter negative past experiences. To inform reflective system design, we examine forecasting and fidelity in controlled field trial interventions that explore two novel system designs for presenting and reflecting on mood data. We detail findings from 165 participants, 4,693 participant logfiles, 65 surveys, and 15 user interviews. Our novel forecasting system, EmotiCal, uses past mood data to model and visualize future user moods with the goal of encouraging participants to adopt remedial new behaviors to regulate negative moods before they occur. Such forecasting both improved mood and subsequent emotional self-awareness compared with controls who simply monitored their past. Consistent with system goals, interview responses also indicated that participants generated important insights into behaviors that affect their moods. Our second intervention examined filtering; it assessed the impact on well-being of recording and revisiting past experiences containing negative emotions. We compared participants who were encouraged to record and reflect on positive versus negative experiences. Long-term measures of happiness and ruminative behaviors improved by recording and reflecting on positive but not negative experiences, although this depended on the intensity of the negative experience. We discuss general design and theory implications for future systems that support monitoring, reflection, and forecasting to facilitate productive examination of our emotional lives.', '');

We find that these principles interact with platform design decisions to create systemic biases in which the sharing economy is significantly more effective in dense, high socioeconomic status (SES) areas than in low-SES areas and the suburbs. We further show that these results are robust across two sharing economy platforms: UberX and TaskRabbit. In addition to highlighting systemic sharing economy biases, this article more fundamentally demonstrates the importance of considering well-known geographic principles when designing and studying sharing economy platforms.', '');

PolarTrack runs a simple detection algorithm on the camera feed to segment displays and track their locations and orientations, which makes PolarTrack particularly suitable as a tracking system for cross-device interaction with mobile devices. Our evaluation of PolarTrack''s tracking quality and comparison with state-of-the-art camera-based multi-device tracking showed a better tracking accuracy and precision with similar tracking reliability.

This paper illuminates the embodied crafting of action possibilities in material-driven design (MDD) practices with electroluminescent materials. The paper describes and discusses aspects of the making process of electroluminescent materials in which matter, structure, form, and computation are manipulated to deliberately disrupt the affordance of the material, with the goal to explore unanticipated action possibilities and materialize the performative qualities of the sample. In light of this account, the paper concludes by urging the HCI community to performatively rupture the material, so to be able to act upon it as if it was always unfinished or underdeveloped. This, it is shown, can help open up the design space of smart material composites and reveal their latent affordances.', '');

Driven by the increasing use of online services and widespread adoption of smartphones (owned by 68% of U.S. residents; Anderson, 2015), personal data take many forms, including communications (e.g., e-mail, SMS, Facebook), plans and coordination (e.g., calendars, TripIt, to-do lists), entertainment consumption (e.g., YouTube, Spotify, Netflix), finances (e.g., banking, Amazon, eBay), activities (e.g., steps, runs, check-ins), and even health care (e.g., doctor visits, medications, heart rate). Collectively, these data provide a highly detailed description of an individual. Personal data afford the opportunity for many new kinds of applications that might improve people’s lives through deep personalization, tools to manage personal well-being, and services that support identity construction. However, developers currently encounter challenges working with personal data due to its fragmentation across services. This article evaluates the landscape of personal data, including the systemic forces that created current fragmented collections of data and the process required for integrating data from across services into an application. It details challenges the fragmented ecosystem imposes. Finally, it contributes Phenom, an experimental system that addresses these challenges, making it easier to develop applications that access personal data and providing users with greater control over how their data are used.', '');

In addition, research in spatial cognition distinguishes many spatial abilities as independent from one another. This implies the need to design content and interactions that target individual spatial abilities in order to further research and support training. Following this approach, we describe the design and implementation for a VR system, “Keep the Ball Rolling”, controlled with tangible inputs and played as a multi-level game. The system is designed around one central spatial ability: penetrative thinking, which is important in geology, biology, human anatomy, and dentistry among other areas.', '');

Two accounts are particularly vocal about these mechanisms, namely the technology acceptance model (TAM) and work on user experience (UX) models. In this study, we review 37 papers in the overlap between TAM and UX models to explore the experiential component of human--computer interactions. The models provide rich insights about what constructs influence the experiential component of human--computer interactions and about how these constructs are related. For example, the effect of perceived enjoyment on attitude is stronger than those of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. It is less clear why the relations exist and under which conditions the models apply. We discuss four of the main theories used in reasoning about the experiential component and, for example, point to the near absence of psychological needs and negative emotions in the models. In addition, most of the reviewed studies are not tied to specific use episodes, thereby bypassing tasks as an explanatory variable and undermining the accurate measurement of experiences, which are susceptible to moment-to-moment changes. We end by summarizing the implications of our review for future research.', '');

In this paper, we analyze empirical data on how users (n=12) interact with our VUI calendar system, DiscoverCal, over three sessions. In particular, we identify the main obstacle categories and types of tactics our participants employ to overcome them. We analyzed the patterns of how different tactics are used in each obstacle category. We found that while NLP Error obstacles occurred the most, other obstacles are more likely to frustrate or confuse the user. We also found patterns that suggest participants were more likely to employ a "guessing" approach rather than rely on visual aids or knowledge recall.', '');

The paper''s contribution is twofold: full documentation is provided for the calculation of the proposed measurement which can be considered as an alternative to the existing proprietary Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA).  Thus, it is possible for researchers to replicate the experiment and build their own software which implements this measurement.  Second, several aspects of the ICA are approached in a more data-sensitive way with the goal of improving the measurement''s performance.', '');

In this paper, we cast the problem of UI distribution as an assignment problem and propose to solve it using combinatorial optimization. We present a mixed integer programming formulation which allows real-time applications in dynamically changing collaborative settings. It optimizes the allocation of UI elements based on device capabilities, user roles, preferences, and access rights.

For this, we conducted a contextual inquiry to understand seniors'' financial management practices. In-depth qualitative data collected both from individual sessions and participatory design activities has revealed significant gaps between the capabilities of existing apps; the best practices around long-term planning; and the attitudes and behaviours of OAs.

We undertake three experimental studies examining people''s perceptions of justice in algorithmic decision-making under different scenarios and explanation styles. Dimensions of justice previously observed in response to human decision-making appear similarly engaged in response to algorithmic decisions. Qualitative analysis identified several concerns and heuristics involved in justice perceptions including arbitrariness, generalisation, and (in)dignity. Quantitative analysis indicates that explanation styles primarily matter to justice perceptions only when subjects are exposed to multiple different styles---under repeated exposure of one style, scenario effects obscure any explanation effects. Our results suggests there may be no `best'' approach to explaining algorithmic decisions, and that reflection on their automated nature both implicates and mitigates justice dimensions.', '');

Therefore, to help the users, all major online organizations deploy information retrieval (content recommendation, search or ranking) systems to find important information. Current information retrieval systems have to make certain design choices. For example, news recommendation systems need to decide on the quality of recommended news stories, how much emphasis to give to a story''s long-term importance over its recency or freshness etc. Similarly, recommendation systems over user generated contents (e.g., in social media like Facebook and Twitter) need to take into account the content posted by heterogeneous user groups. However, such design choices can introduce unintended biases in the contents presented to the users. For example, the recommended contents may have poor quality or less news value, or the news discourse may get hijacked by hyper-active demographic groups. In this thesis, we want to systematically measure the effect of such design choices in the content recommendation systems, and build alternate recommendation systems that mitigate the biases in the recommendation output.', '');
